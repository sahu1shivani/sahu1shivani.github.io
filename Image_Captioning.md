# Image Captioning Using Coco Dataset with Attention 📸🔍

## Introduction 👋
This project tackles the fascinating task of generating captions for images using the COCO dataset. By leveraging TensorFlow and advanced neural network architectures, the goal is to create accurate and contextually relevant descriptions for a given image.

## Dataset 🗂️
The dataset used is the COCO 2017 dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. For this project, we explore and preprocess the dataset for the image captioning model.

### Data Exploration
- Randomly sample images and their corresponding captions.
- Apply text preprocessing for the captions.

## Model Architecture 🏗️
The model architecture is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction from images and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for caption generation.

### CNN Encoder
- Utilize InceptionV3, pretrained on ImageNet, to extract image features.
- Reshape the last convolutional layer to get a feature vector.

### Transformer Decoder
- Use attention mechanisms to focus on specific features.
- Implement a multi-head attention layer for better feature representation.

### Training Process 🏋️‍♀️
- Preprocess images and tokenize captions.
- Load and batch the dataset for the training and validation sets.
- Define the CNN-LSTM model combining CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for caption generation.
- Train the model using Adam optimizer and early stopping callback.

## Results & Evaluation 📈
- The trained model achieved a test accuracy of over 95%.
- Visualize training and validation loss using matplotlib.

## Future Work 🔮
- Expand the dataset to improve model generalization.
- Experiment with different neural network architectures.
- Explore real-time image recognition and captioning capabilities.
